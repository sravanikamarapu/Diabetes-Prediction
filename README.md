Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

#### Abstract:

Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patientâ€™s overall health has been
particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers
around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical
condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for
incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or
unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions
such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to
transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or
system.Knowledge about chronic conditions such as diabetes can inform clinical
decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

To achieve this goal,in this project we do an early prediction of Diabetes in the
human body through applying various Machine Learning techniques. Machine
learning techniques provide better results for prediction by constructing models
from datasets collected from patients. In this project we used Machine Learning
Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes, which
are Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) ,Random Forest (RF) and
XGBoost(XGB). The accuracy is different for each model.The model with higher
accuracy is capable of predicting diabetes effectively.

Our result shows that XGBoost achieved higher accuracy compared to other
machine learning techniques.


#### Methodology:

Five different methods were used in this paper. The
different methods used are defined below. The output is the accuracy metrics of
the machine learning models. Then, the model can be used in prediction

#### Dataset Description:

The data set used is
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2021/data . The objective is
to predict if the patient is diabetic or not.
The dataset contains 130,157 rows and 181 columns. Diabetes Mellitus is the
feature we are going to predict.

## 1. Logistic Regression

          Training Accuracy 70-30 -> 81.42 <br />
          Training Accuracy 80-20 -> 81.23

## 2. Decision Tree

          Training Accuracy 70-30 -> 74.78 <br />
          Training Accuracy 80-20 -> 74.63

## 3. Random Forest

          Training Accuracy 70-30 -> 80.56 <br />
          Training Accuracy 80-20 -> 80.12

## 4. XGBoost

          Training Accuracy 70-30 -> 82.61 <br />
          Training Accuracy 80-20 -> 82.38
The above data shows that XG Boost gives the highest accuracy of 82.61%


#### Conclusion:

One of the important real-world medical problems is the detection of diabetes at
its early stage. In this study, systematic efforts are made in designing a system
which results in the prediction of diabetes. During this work, four machine
learning classification algorithms are studied and evaluated on various
measures.In future, the designed system with the used machine learning
classification algorithms can be used to predict or diagnose other diseases. The
work can be extended and improved for the automation of diabetes analysis
including some other machine learning algorithms.
